Need to create a queu called Yo-Yo.
Ctrl Pnl -> Programs -> Turn on Features-> Turn on Microsoft Msg Q (I did this already)

CMpt management -> services -> messaging Q -> right click - create nw private q

consider writing the data to a different type of table.
think about triggers, denormalizing data so I don't need joins
Indexing will get nuked over time - how will you fix this?
